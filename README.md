Northwind: A Journey from SQL Basics to Advanced T-SQL

This repo includes my development process starting with basic querying techniques on the Northwind database,
extending to enterprise-level T-SQL competencies.
These projects, prepared under the mentorship of a Software Developer during my internship, aim not only to retrieve data but also to
process it into meaningful reports.

📂 Project Content and Technical Scope File creation,
1. Database Installation 
**scripts/_Northwind_Database_Setup.sql**
My Setup Process (Kurulum Sürecim)
If you would like to explore or test the analysis queries in this project
you will first need to set up the database environment. I have prepared a primary script to make this process seamless.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Exploring My Analysis (Analizlerimi İnceleme)
Once you have completed the setup, you can examine my scripts in any order. I personally developed each of these files to:

Solve specific business problems I encountered during my internship.

Practice and demonstrate my proficiency in complex T-SQL concepts such as CTEs, Window Functions, and Multi-layered Joins.

  Covers all the basic and advanced competencies a SQL developer would need:
  1) Data Manipulation and Basic Querying Fundamentals: Data cleaning and filtering using functions such as Using_Between, Using_Like&,Len, Using_Round, and Using_Distinct.
  **
  --CRUD Operations: The logic of Update_Insert_Delete for data management.
  --Date Functions: Using_Datediff and Date_Based_Sales_Using_Cast for time-based analyses.
  
  2)Advanced T-SQL Techniques CTE (Common Table Expressions):Using_CTE to make complex queries readable and manageable.
  --Window Functions: RowNumber & PartitionBy for analyzing datasets by dividing them into partitions.
  --Subqueries & Logic: Using_Exists and complex HAVING constructs for entity checks and performant filtering.
  --Temporary Tables: Using_TEMP_TABLE for large data processing.
  
  3)Business Intelligence Customer Analysis:
  --Customer_Based_Analysis for customer segmentation and detailed spending reports.
  --Personnel Performance: Measuring employee productivity with TotalSales_BasedOn_PersonnelID.
  --Category-Based Summaries: SumProducts_
  --EachCategory for inventory and sales balance analysis.
